## Submitting Contributions👩‍💻👨‍💻
Below you will find the process and workflow used to review and merge your changes.

### Step 0 : Find an issue  🔍
- Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your **own** Issues!
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.
- Note : Every change in this project should/must have an associated issue.

### Step 1 : Fork the Project 🍴
- Fork this Repository. This will create a Local Copy of this Repository on your Github Profile. Keep a reference to the original project in `upstream` remote.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Musicophilia
# Navigate to the project directory.
$ cd Musicophilia
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/nilisha-jais/Musicophilia
```
This is how you can fork the repository.

- If you have already forked the project, update your copy before working.
```
$ git remote update
$ git checkout <branch-name>
$ git rebase upstream/<branch-name>
```

### Step 2 : Branch  🔖
Create a new branch. Use its name to identify the issue your addressing.
```
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to that branch
$ git checkout -b Branch_Name
```

### Step 3 : Work on the issue assigned  📕
- Work on the issue(s) assigned to you.
- Add all the files/folders needed.
- After you've made changes or made your contribution to the project add changes to the branch you've just created by:
```
# To add all new files to branch Branch_Name
$ git add .
```
```
# To add only a few files to Branch_Name
$ git add <some files>
```

### Step 4 : Commit
- To commit give a descriptive message for the convenience of reviewer by:
```
# This message get associated with all files you have changed
$ git commit -m "message"
```
- **NOTE**: A PR should have only one commit. Multiple commits should be squashed.

### Step 5 : Work Remotely
- Now you are ready to your work to the remote repository.
- When your work is ready and complies with the project conventions, upload your changes to your fork:

```
# To push your work to your remote repository
$ git push -u origin Branch_Name
```
- Here is how your branch will look.
